# Documentation Resources
This repo contains links to resources related to documentation. It is intended to help you understand the importance of well-written documentation, and simultaneously provide a source of truth for documentation in a given language.

## Guide
Just view the LANGUAGEHERE.md file for your preferred language to view associated resources :)

## Don't want to do it yourself?
Yeah, documentation sucks! That's why we started Trelent. Send us a note at contact@trelent.net and we can discuss automating the documentation for your private repo, or giving your developers the tools to do so at scale!
