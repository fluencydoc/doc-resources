# Python Documentation
Documenting Python code is pretty straightforward! It is broken up into two components: comments, and docstrings.

## Docstrings
Python docstrings go by a few main formats, here are the resources for each of those!

### *reStructuredText - PEP 287*
reStructuredText (reST for short) is a docstring format that leverages the popular plain-text syntax language known as, well, reST. reST ***is not*** exclusively used for Python. This is great, because docstrings written use it gain the ability to be used in the vast ecosystem of reST tools!

- [Spec](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/)

Example ([thanks, Trelent](https://trelent.net)):
```python
def mult_nums(nums):
    """
    Multiplies all the numbers in a list of numbers.

    :author: Generated by Trelent
    :param nums: The list of numbers to multiply.
    :type nums: list
    :returns: The product of all the numbers in the list.
    :rtype: int
    """
    result = 1
    for num in nums:
        result *= num
    return result
```

### *Google*
The Google format is a python docstring format style that is widely used, but which originated as a part of Google's internal Python styling guide. It is extremely human-readable, and emphasizes this over support for automated tooling.

- [Spec](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)

Example ([thanks, Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html)):
```python
def func(arg1, arg2):
    """Summary line.

    Extended description of function.

    Args:
        arg1 (int): Description of arg1
        arg2 (str): Description of arg2

    Returns:
        bool: Description of return value

    """
    return True
```

### *NumPy Docstring Standard*
The NumPy Docstring standard is a documentation format standardized by the popular open source math library, NumPy. It is also extremely human-readable, and emphasizes this over support for automated tooling.
- [Spec](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard)

Example ([thanks, Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html)):
```python
def func(arg1, arg2):
    """Summary line.

    Extended description of function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg1 : int
        Description of arg1
    arg2 : str
        Description of arg2

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Description of return value

    """
    return True
```

## Comments
Code commenting is super helpful to other developers when used in moderation. Comments should be primarily used to explain the, *ahem*, intricate components of your code.


### The do's and don'ts
___
Python comments are really simple to use! Just prefix your comment with a `#` character like so:
```python
# <Your comment goes here>
```

A comment can be on its own line:
```python
def foo(a,b):
    # This is a comment!
    return a+b
```

A comment can follow a piece of code on the same line:
```python
def foo(a,b):
    return a+b # This is also a comment!
```

Try not to over-use them, docstrings are meant to explain what a broader snippet of code does, not comments!

**Good example**:
```python
def foo(a,b):
    """Adds together the numbers a and b"""
    return a+b
```

**Bad example**:
```python
def foo(a,b):
    # Start with our variables a and b, and add them together
    c = a+b

    # Great, now return the computed sum as c
    return c
```
